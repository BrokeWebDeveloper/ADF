### First go to Fonts folder and make a new folder named your {font family} inside make a README.md and make your description, then upload your Font-Family inside your {font family} folder :)
### Also inside your {font family} folder make a LICENSE.txt and paste a OFL License, To get the license go here : https://choosealicense.com/licenses/ofl-1.1/
# What Language?
### You can make it any language! :) I recommend english Tho. If you want to make a Japanese languaged font it is really helpful :)) 
### If it's an Adobe Latin i'll follow/star your repository IMMEDIATELY because Adobe Latin has a plethora of Glyphs for any language except symbol languages like Japanese, Hindi, ETC like those
